# rust_pong
My implementation of pong, one of the first video games in history, in rust. It is a reinforcement learning project.

This is a simple template repository. It has the game logic and very basic rendering. It does not read any input from keyboard or mouse. You can add your own code if you want to read keyboard input.
The reason why I did not add event handling is that I first created this project as a reinforcement learning project.

Make sure to have SDL2 installed on your machine before trying to build this project.
